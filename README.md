# gohdotfiles
The repository is maintained only by me and a lot of the usage/content is very specific to myself or my environments.  

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

## About
This repository contains some of the following:
- scripts and flows for bootstrapping environemts
- dotfiles
- configurations

I would love to have more of a tidy up and a refactor, however, I feel that there are bigger things to worry about, currently :)

## Usage


Ensure you have `make` installed.
```
cd gohdotfiles
make
```
