The repository is maintained only by me and a lot of the usage/content is very specific to myself or my environments.  

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

## About
This repository contains some of the following:
- scripts and flows for bootstrapping environemts
- dotfiles
- configurations

I would love to have more of a tidy up and a refactor, however, I feel that there are bigger things to worry about, currently :)

## Usage

For a fresh install you probably want to:  

```bash
# 1. Ensure you have `git` and `make` installed.
sudo apt install git make

# 2. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/glynternet/gohdotfiles.git

# 3. Change directory to repo
cd gohdotfiles

# 4. Call make to start the installation
make
```
